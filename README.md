# Introduction

_This is a work in progress README._

This repo contains a simple *Xamarin.Forms* app to access Twitter.
With this app you can read your timeline and post a tweet (text only).

**Xamarin.Forms + Twitter = Xwitter**

# Know issues and limitations

The UWP flavor of the app crashes at the moment of this writing because of this [known bug of Xamarin.Auth](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Auth/issues/236).

The iOS version of the app is not tested.

If you encouter the followin error or random deployment errors you need to delete bin and obj folder of the project and redeploy. Running Visual Studio 2017 as admin may help.
